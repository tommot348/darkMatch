# darkMatch - mmo top down arena shooter

This is very much WIP, nothing is really there. Furthermore this is just
a project to play with pixi.js and Heroku for the server side of things.
There's no guaranty that I ever finish this.

## Features:
  * Random map generator
## Features I would like to add:

  * Landing page
  * match-browser
  * User statistics (W/L Kill/Death ratio etc. )
